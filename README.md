## LEAD SOFTWARE ENGINEER

Lead engineer with 11+ years of software engineering experience, specializing in building and modernizing cloud systems on Azure. Known for simplifying complex domains, speeding up delivery with test automation and strong DevEx, and enabling teams through documentation standards and mentoring. Heavy daily user of Copilot (Instructions, CLI, agent mode) to translate legacy code into knowledge, automate repeatable platform work, and accelerate upgrades. Ready to partner with Solution Architecture Manager to deliver credible AI PoCs and scale adoption across the developer community.

## SELECTED HIGHLIGHTS

- **Release velocity:** Automated manual regression suites (unit, system, UI) → cut runtime **3 days → 15 minutes**; **moved releases from monthly → bi‑weekly**.
- **Real‑time pricing:** Reduced **same‑day price propagation from 2+ hours → < 2 minutes**.
- **Revenue enablement:** Delivered flexible **price‑markup** capability (global/department/category/class/item) powering incremental revenue and faster experimentation.
- **Onboarding & docs:** Built a documentation ecosystem and review process → **new‑hire onboarding reduced from ~2 weeks → 3 days**.
- **Mentoring:** Ongoing 1:1 coaching; guided an **Associate SQE → Lead Software Engineer**.
- **Copilot at scale:** Team‑level Copilot Instructions, CLI‑based code comprehension/flowcharts for legacy code, agent‑assisted **.NET upgrades** , and prompt packs that offload repeatable tasks (code + KQL + pipelines + Bicep + docs).

## EXPERIENCE

### Wegmans Food Markets — Lead Software Engineer  *(2024–Present)*

#### AI & Copilot Enablement

- Institutionalized **Copilot Instructions** across repos to encode framework preferences, code style, and contribution rules; boosted first‑pass quality and reduced nit‑level review churn.
- Used **Copilot CLI** to ingest legacy mainframe code modules and generate **business rules, inputs/outputs, and flowcharts**; established a refreshable documentation pipeline that de‑risks migration of MFR features into the **Price** app.
- Executed **agent‑assisted .NET upgrades** with the **.NET Upgrade Wizard Agent**; resolved API/library diffs while keeping CI/CD green.
- Built **prompt packs** that generate end‑to‑end scaffolding for health checks and alerts—**service code + KQL + pipeline + Bicep + docs**—offloading repeatable platform work. Recent win: automated **coupon‑sequence exhaustion monitoring** in three prompts.

#### Velocity, Quality, and Reliability

- Led the design and rollout of a multi‑layer **test automation** strategy (unit/system/UI), cutting regression runtime **3 days → 15 minutes** and enabling **bi‑weekly** releases with higher confidence.
- Drove pricing pipeline improvements to **reduce same‑day price propagation from 2+ hours → < 2 minutes**, enabling near‑real‑time updates.

#### Product & Platform Outcomes

- Architected and delivered **flexible price‑markup capabilities** for e‑commerce (global/department/category/class/item), unlocking incremental revenue and faster merchandising tests.
- Created a centralized **documentation repo**, standards, and review workflow; implemented onboarding/contribution guides that **reduced onboarding time from ~2 weeks → 3 days** and improved consistency/discoverability.
- Drove adoption of **local development environments** (SQL Server, Cosmos DB, Azure Storage Emulator); built an automated setup tool that eliminates manual configuration, enabling engineers to run the full stack locally with zero cloud dependencies.

#### Leadership & Mentoring

- Mentor to multiple engineers with regular 1:1s focused on growth and role clarity; **coached an Associate SQE → Lead SWE** through sustained guidance and project opportunities.
- Provide architectural guidance, patterns, and review cadences that increase team autonomy and delivery consistency.

#### Stack & Tools

Azure (Functions, App Service, ADF, Storage), Cosmos DB, Graph DB, SQL Server, Event Grid, Service Bus, .NET/C#, ASP.NET Core, Angular, NSB, Azure DevOps Pipelines, ARM/**Bicep**/Template Specs, App Insights/KQL, Azure Monitor Alerts, Entra ID (RBAC/OAuth), TLS/security policies, GitHub/M365 Copilot (Instructions/CLI/Agent)

> *Earlier roles (prior to Lead SWE):* • Software Engineer • Senior Programmer Analyst • Programmer Analyst • Programmer — details available on request

## SELECTED PROJECTS & POCs

- **Code‑to‑Knowledge for Legacy C (MFR → Price App):** Automated production of **business rules, data contracts, and flowcharts** from legacy code with Copilot CLI to enable safe migrations and ongoing regeneration as code evolves.  
- **Real‑time Pricing Responsiveness:** Event‑driven updates, observability (App Insights/alerts), and resiliency patterns to ensure price changes propagate in **minutes**.  
- **DevEx Accelerators:** Reusable patterns for health checks/alerts and CI/IaC, reducing time‑to‑production for new services and eliminating common omissions.
